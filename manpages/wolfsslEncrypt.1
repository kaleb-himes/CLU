.SH NAME
encrypt \- cipher routines
.SH SYNOPSIS
cyassl encrypt <-algorithm> <-i filename> [-o filename] [-k password] [-iv IV]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command allows data to be encrypted using ciphers and keys based on passwords if not explicitly provided
.SH ALGORITHMS
-aes-cbc-[128|192|256]
        uses AES algorithm with designated key size.

-aes-ctr-[128|192|256]
        uses AES Counter with designated key size. 
        to use the -ctr option you must use the following:
        "#define CYASSL_AES_COUNTER"

-3des-cbc-[056|112|168]
        uses 3DES algorithm with designated key size.

-camellia-cbc-[128|192|256]
        uses Camellia algorithm with designated key size. Only available if ./configure settings support
.SH OPTIONS
-i filename/stdin     the input filename, standard input. If file does not exist, it will treat data as stdin
-o filename           the output filename, if filename does not exist, it will be created
-k password           password to derive the key from. prompts if password option is not provided. If used, iv isn't needed
-iv IV                the actual iv to use. If not provided, one is randomly generated. Must be provided in hex
-K Key                the actual key to use. Must be in hex

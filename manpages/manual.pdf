Welcome to the CyaSSL Command Line Utility Manual!

The first thing that will need to be done is a complete download and install of
CyaSSL. An instructional video of this process can be found here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXRLwW0DIPA

Next view the README.md file. Which says this:

To use this feature, please ./configure --enable-pwdbased 
    other features that can be included are:
        --enable-camellia
        --enable-blake2
        --enable-sha512
        --enable-fortress

then run make from the programs folder

The Utility has many tools. Encryption, Decryption, Hashing, Benchmarking, with
more to come.

The man pages provided with the utility also give a brief rundown of how to use
each tool in the kit.

To install the man pages extract all of them in place and then run the 
following commands from the directory containing the man pages.

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    sudo cp wolfssl*.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    sudo mandb

You will now be able to run a man page by typing "man 1 cu_benchmark" etc.

ENCRYPTION

    SYNOPSIS
        cyassl encrypt <-algorithm> <-i filename> [-o filename] [-k password] [-iv IV]
    DESCRIPTION
        This command allows data to be encrypted using ciphers and keys based on passwords if not explicitly provided
    .ALGORITHMS
        -aes-cbc-[128|192|256]
            uses AES algorithm with designated key size.
        -aes-ctr-[128|192|256]
            uses AES Counter with designated key size. Only available if ./congigure settings support 
        -3des-cbc-[056|112|168]
            uses 3DES algorithm with designated key size.
        -camellia-cbc-[128|192|256]
            uses Camellia algorithm with designated key size. Only available if ./configure settings support
    OPTIONS
        -i filename/stdin     the input filename, standard input. If file does not exist, it will treat data as stdin
        -o filename           the output filename, if filename does not exist, it will be created
        -k password           password to derive the key from. prompts if password option is not provided. If used, iv isn't needed
        -iv IV                the actual iv to use. If not provided, one is randomly generated. Must be provided in hex
        -K Key                the actual key to use. Must be in hex

DECRYPTION

    SYNOPSIS
        cyassl decrypt <-algorithm> <-i filename> [-o filename] [-k password] [-iv IV]

            uses AES algorithm with designated key size.
        -aes-ctr-[128|192|256]
            uses AES Counter with designated key size. Only available if ./congigure settings support 
        -3des-cbc-[056|112|168]
            uses 3DES algorithm with designated key size.
        -camellia-cbc-[128|192|256]
            uses Camellia algorithm with designated key size. Only available if ./configure settings support
    OPTIONS
        -i filename/stdin     the input filename, standard input. If file does not exist, it will treat data as stdin
        -o filename           the output filename, if filename does not exist, it will be created
        -k password           password to derive the key from. prompts if password option is not provided. If used, iv isn't needed
        -iv IV                the actual iv to use. If not provided, one is randomly generated. Must be provided in hex
        -K Key                the actual key to use. Must be in hex

HASH

    SYNOPSIS
        cyassl hash <-algorithm> <-i filename> [-o filename/stdin] [-s size] [-l length]
    DESCRIPTION
        This command hashes either stdin or a file based on the chosen algorithm
    ALGORITHMS
        -md5
        -sha
        -sha256
        (NOTE: The following are only available if ./configure supports them)
        -sha384
        -sha512
        -blake2b
    OPTIONS
        -i filename/stdin       the input filename, standard input. If file does not exist, it will treat data as stdin
        -o filename             the output filename, if not provided will print stdout
        -s size                 block size of the function. Usuable only with Blake2b
        -l length               length of message to hash

BENCHMARK

    SYNOPSIS
        cyassl benchmark TESTS [-t time] [-all] [-tests] 
    DESCRIPTION
        Tests algorithm functionality and speed

    OPTIONS
        -t time     time for each of the tests in seconds
        -all        runs all available tests

TESTING
        
    Various tests can also be performed on the toolkit via nistTest.sh and tests.sh
    to perform these tests, simply change the 'PAT' variable in each one to lead
    to where you extracted the Utility to.
